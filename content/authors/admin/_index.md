I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [Key Lab of High Confidence Software Technologies(PKU), Ministry of Education](http://hcst.pku.edu.cn) working with Prof. [Zhi Jin](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/zhijin) and Prof. [Ge Li](https://ligechina.github.io). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Yunzhan Gong](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/info/1292/2713.htm). My research interests sit at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a focus on intelligent software testing.
